I am using Derby as database.  You can find the derby data inside the derby folder.  You can copy this folder into your preferred location in your file system.  Then you need to set the url connection in the dbconnection.properties file, to the location of your derby database.

url=jdbc:derby:/Users/Admin/Documents/workspace1/lebah4/derby/db;create=true

Replase the /Users/Admin/Documents/workspace1/lebah4/ to the location of where your derby folder located.
